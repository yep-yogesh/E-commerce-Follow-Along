# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

Project Description

The Ecommerce Follow Along project is designed to help developers build a full-stack e-commerce web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). This project follows a hands-on approach, where you will learn and implement key concepts such as user authentication, product management, and order handling through RESTful APIs. By the end of the project, you will have built a functioning e-commerce platform with core features, using JavaScript across both the client and server side.

The MERN stack allows for a seamless and efficient development process, providing a unified language (JavaScript) for the entire stack, making it easier for developers to build, scale, and maintain web applications.

**Milestone 1: **

Project Overview
In this milestone, we introduced the foundations of building a full-stack e-commerce application using the MERN stack. Key topics covered include:

1. Overview of the MERN Stack
The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for building modern, scalable, and fast web applications. The stack consists of:
MongoDB (database)
Express.js (backend framework)
React.js (frontend library)
Node.js (JavaScript runtime)
The key advantage of MERN is its JavaScript-only approach, where both the front-end and back-end are built using JavaScript, making development easier and more efficient.
2. REST API Structure and Endpoints
We explored REST APIs (Representational State Transfer) and their role in allowing communication between the client and server.
Key API endpoints were introduced to handle:
User Authentication: Register and log in users with secure authentication.
Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
Order Handling: Manage customer orders from creation to checkout.
These APIs interact with the database, responding with data in JSON format.
3. Basics of Database Schema Design
In MongoDB, schema design involves defining the structure of data stored in the database, including relationships between different collections such as users, products, and orders.
The schema plays a critical role in ensuring data consistency and making it easier to query.
4. Role of Authentication in Web Applications
Authentication verifies the identity of a user before granting access to certain features or data.
In this project, we focused on building secure authentication mechanisms, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their orders.
We implemented techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to securely handle user sessions.
Features Implemented
User Authentication:

Sign up and login features using JWT for secure sessions.
Product Management:

Add, update, and view products within the e-commerce platform.
Order Management:

Create, update, and view customer orders.
